##### Question 1: [Judge whether the goods are qualified or not](./src/main/java/or/hjj/interview/TestQualifiedGood.java)
Description:

    Currently there are n items, each of which has three parameters: ai, bi, ci and the definition of unqualified 
    items is based on: if there is j item, so that aj>ai, bj>bi, cj>ci, then i item is unqualified. Output the 
    number of unqualified items. 
    
For Example:

    Input
    3
    1 4 2
    2 4 2
    2 5 3
    
    output
    1
    
Should use standard IO: `System.in` and `System.out`.

may this help you!
