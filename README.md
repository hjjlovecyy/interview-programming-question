#### Question 1: [Judge whether the goods are qualified or not](./src/main/java/or/hjj/interview/TestQualifiedGood.java)
Description:

    Currently there are n items, each of which has three parameters: ai, bi, ci and the definition of unqualified 
    items is based on: if there is j item, so that aj>ai, bj>bi, cj>ci, then i item is unqualified. Output the 
    number of unqualified items. 
    
For Example:

    Input
    3
    1 4 2
    2 4 2
    2 5 3
    
    output
    1
    
Should use standard IO: `System.in` and `System.out`.

    one is to get an ID without repetition and one is to get the total number of generated ids.
    
Two Method:
```Java
// generate str
public String generator() {}
// total number
public int getTotal() {}
```
#### Question 3: [Merge two sorted array to an array](./src/main/java/or/hjj/interview/TwoArrayMerge.java)
